# Advanced SQL Queries – Airbnb Clone

## Objective

Practice complex SQL operations such as joins, aggregations, and window functions on the Airbnb Clone database.

## Description

This directory includes two main tasks:

### 1. SQL Join Queries

- **INNER JOIN** – Retrieve all bookings with the users who made them.
- **LEFT JOIN** – List all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** – Show all users and all bookings, even if they are not linked.

### 2. Aggregations and Window Functions

- **Aggregations** – Count the total number of bookings per user using `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY`.
- **Window Functions** – Rank properties based on total bookings using `RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()`.
